# ðŸ§  ForeSight ML Model

This repository contains the **Machine Learning model API** for [ForeSight](https://fore-sight-eight.vercel.app/) â€” a finance management system that predicts and visualizes student expenses.  
It combines **Random Forest Regression** and **Exponential Smoothing** to forecast future spending across multiple categories.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The ML model processes user transaction data to:
1. Predict **next month's expenses per category** (Food, Leisure, Academic, etc.) using **Random Forest**.  
2. Forecast **total monthly expenditure** using **Exponential Smoothing**.  
3. Combine both predictions through a **confidence-weighted average** based on recent model performance (RÂ² score).
